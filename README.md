## Code Fellows Lab07 Start for API

**Author**: Nicholas Brown
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- The purpose of this lab is to build a back end that will eventually communicate and interact with the front end webpage that we created for City Explorer.

## Getting Started

1. Create the server
2. Download node/json package templates to build the project
3. Input initial data for server operation
4. Verify data can get to endpoint


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
